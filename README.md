### Rachel Nguyen
I am pursuing a bachelor degree in Information Technology at the [University of Massachussets - Boston](https://www.umb.edu/). 
I am interested in big data, machine learning, web design, and cloud computing. I have an understanding of several programming languages, but I prefer Python. I also love experimenting with Excel, Tableau, R... In addition to studying at UMass, I have taken multiple online classes at other institutions. I love to work in groups and be part of a successful team collaberating on large projects that have a positive impact on the environment. My goal one day is to be a system adminitrator or a data scientist and lead a team of successful IT professionals.
