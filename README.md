### Rachel Nguyen
I am pursuing a bachelor degree in Information Technology at the [University of Massachussets - Boston](https://www.umb.edu/). 
I am interested in automation, big data, machine learning, web design, and cloud computing. I have an understanding of several programming languages, but I prefer Python. I also love experimenting with Excel, Tableau, R... In addition to studying at UMass, I have taken multiple online classes at other institutions. I love to work in groups and be part of a successful team collaborating on large projects that have a positive impact on the environment.
